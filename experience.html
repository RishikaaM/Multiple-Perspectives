   Vision Pro, introduced in June 2023, is a real leap even by Apple’s measure. The way Apple has chosen to mix digital and physical elements of the user’s environment is incredible. In essence, the company transforms the owner’s environment Vision Pro into a three-dimensional navigation display - its interface, consisting of already familiar Mac and iPhone elements, is understandable and easy to operate. 
<br><br>
        Any digital content in Vision Pro looks like it’s actually in the room. This effect is achieved by working on the UX design - each element has been designed to minimize the difference between the digital elements and the physical environment in the user’s eyes. To do this, Apple created a special virtual material glass. 
        <br><br>
        What is all this? Its analogues you can see in any Apple interface are translucent windows that can host application icons (as in iPhone folders) and settings screen (as in new macOS). Here it adapts not to the wallpaper or the window that is open under the application, but under your environment. The screens in the interface change their shades depending on where they are displayed, while application icons, display content, etc. retain their colors and contrast.</p>

    <p>

      Apps can also fill the entire virtual space around you. For example, during a meditation session. 
      <br><br>
      EyeSight is a truly innovative technology. It makes Vision Pro lenses transparent when someone approaches the user. Eye contact is thus established on both sides.
      <br><br>
      In full immersion mode, Vision Pro lenses appear opaque. However, when a user looks at someone, a virtual porthole is formed in the helmet, giving the impression to his interlocutor that he is looking at him. It took years to develop this single Vision Pro feature.</p>

    Environments is a set of virtual spaces in which a user can perform their tasks or simply view content. For example, you can become a visitor to a virtual 1,200-inch cinema located over a lake near the stratovolkan Mount Hood in Oregon. 
    <br><br>
    All technological and software solutions used in Apple Vision Pro have been developed specifically for it. During the development of the device, the Apple design team constantly studied something new and mastered new skills: to create a unique set of gestures, to understand which materials are best suited for such a device; to develop unique virtual spaces and their sound design.</p>

    The visionOS user can move apps anywhere, scale windows with them to the perfect size for him. The visionOS interface adapts to the lighting of your room and even casts shadows in the virtual space.
    <br><br>
    The experience of using Apple Vision Pro is based on an individual attitude and personalized approach to each owner. The device is modular and suitable for the widest range of people with a variety of facial features. To do this, a special lightweight seal made of soft textiles - it is available in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, and after a pair of socks, it will perfectly adapt to the face of the wearer Vision Pro.
    <br><br>
    Before using Vision Pro, users are asked to create a 3D model of their face and ears using a camera, almost like the first time using a Face ID to customize landing, visual effects, and most importantly - sound distribution. The fact is that in Vision Pro there are no headphones - instead they use advanced audio system. 
    <br><br>
    It allows users to both enjoy the sound of the content being viewed and hear the sounds of the outside world. Vision Pro has two speakers that provide high quality sound. Flexible straps allow the device to be attached to the user’s head as comfortably as possible.</p>

    Apple Vision Pro allows you to enter text on a floating keyboard, but this is not very convenient. There is no tactile feedback, although when you type text you hear clicks. And you can’t type very quickly.
    I love that you can input text with your voice. For example, if you are in Safari, just look at the microphone icon in the address bar and name the address of the site, after which the browser will immediately open it.
    You can also always connect the Bluetooth keyboard to Vision Pro to simplify and speed up text input.</p>

    Input methods. If you want to know how to design for Apple Vision Pro, first, you need to learn how they collect input. Input is collected through direct and indirect gestures. The user performs an indirect gesture by looking at an item and performing a “tap” by tapping or closing their fingers together.
    Moreover, the user performs a direct gesture by reaching their hand to “touch” a virtual object with a finger.
    Apple Vision Pro has one of the rare interfaces that doesn’t use external hardware for input, such as a mouse, keyboard, or screen.</p>

  <p>
    Choose appropriate gestures. When designing interactions, prioritize indirect gestures for optimal user experience. Indirect gestures enable interaction with objects at any distance, which promotes ease of use. Direct gestures, suitable for nearby objects, may become fatiguing for users, especially if repeated frequently. If you want to successfully design for Apple Vision Pro, reserve direct gestures for objects requiring manipulation or inspection, ensuring minimal physical effort from users.</p>
