          Vision Pro is not just an accessory. It is a full-fledged new type computer that replaces both TV and monitors, and can handle a large amount of data. It is important that the headset is not connected to the iPhone or Mac - it is completely independent device. 

          What’s the future of this device?

      <span>Will Vision Pro Change Our Habits</span>
      <p>
        According to experts, the release of Vision Pro at least will start hype cycle on the market. And as a maximum - finally will make users stop humping and looking into a small screen in your hand. The device can revolutionize content consumption: a multi-window interface will affect the speed of information perception, and user attention will become an even more expensive resource.
        <br><br>
        Apple promises that Vision Pro will change the usual practices of media consumption.
        <br><br>
        "People will start consuming even more content. At the same time, it will be possible to watch the NBA basketball game, the NHL broadcast, and a video of Trump as the next president. Users have already learned to read information in several windows, and with the development of such technologies, this skill will be strengthened."
        <b>- Andrei Blumenthal, Worldwide Managing Director, Go Mobile</b> <br><br>
        In addition, Vision Pro has the potential to:
        <br>
        - Completely replace laptops;<br>
        - Improve health monitoring;<br>
        - Record volumetric memories that can then be played;<br>
        - Create an immersive environment that completely surrounds the person and helps him to learn, work or rest.</p>

    <span>Apple Vision Pro 2</span>
    <p>
      The second-generation Apple Vision Pro headset, known internally as the Project Alaska and N109 device identifier, bears striking similarities to the first-generation Vision Pro announced on WWDC 2023. Although the device retains the curved appearance and location of the buttons of the first Vision Pro, it is expected that the location of the speakers will be different.
      <br><br>
      The early designs of the second generation Apple headsets lacked rounded areas that housed the dynamics of the first generation model. Instead, the headsets are flat and homogeneous along the length of the headbands. The documentation related to the Alaska project contains links to an audio accessory of unknown origin, possibly an external speaker. At one stage of development, the upper vents had two different configurations - one was the same as the first generation Apple Vision Pro, and the other had two groups of tiny holes in the form of speakers.
      <br><br>
      Another key difference relates to the rear straps. The second generation headset is equipped with belts of simpler design and appearance, which somewhat resemble flat straps, usually used in laptop bags or backpacks. Previously, there were rumors that the next Apple headset might be cheaper than the Vision Pro, and the design of the second-generation back belts supports this theory. Streamlined straps would probably be easier to produce serially, possibly reducing the overall price for end users.
      <br><br>
      Information from our sources suggests that Apple plans to purchase an external battery pack similar to the battery pack used in the Apple Vision Pro first generation, in addition to the possibility of using an audio accessory.
      <br><br>
      For hardware, the second generation Vision Pro will still include a set of cameras and sensors similar to those in the first headset. To be more precise, the device will be equipped with a compass, ambient light sensor, magnetometer and gyroscope, all of which are already present in the iPhone. As for the connection, the Apple headset of the second generation will support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5 and ultralow latency sound (ULLA).

      <br><br>
      Apple’s second generation key hardware components:
      <br>
  
- 2 micro-OLED displays <br>
- 1 TrueDepth camera <br>
- 4 Computer Vision Cameras (CV) <br>
- 2 RGB cameras <br>
- 2 infrared lights with low light level <br>
- Semi-automatic pupil distance adjustment (IPD) <br>
- Compass, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, accelerometer, gyroscope <br><br>
     Current information indicates that the development of the second-generation Apple headset at the validation phase of the product (PVT) is scheduled for 2025, assuming a release date of late 2025 or early 2026. The information we shared is taken from a reliable source that has in the past provided us with detailed information about Apple’s plans, but it is worth noting that this is pre-series information, and Apple plans may change before the final mass production of the second generation headset.
