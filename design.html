        <h1>Design Perspective</h1>
        <p>
          Truly unique design. The front part of the device is a single part of a multilayer glass of three-dimensional shape, which elegantly passes into a body made of aluminum alloy. Due to the use of materials of the highest quality, the device looks as premium and attractive as possible. The Apple Vision Pro accessory, adjacent to the face, gently bends, flexibly adjusting to the features of the wearer of the device, providing the most comfortable sensation and blocking diffused light. In this case, the complete belt is easy to stretch, air leak, and suitable for all.

      <p>Apple Vision Pro is impressive compared to similar headsets of other manufacturers, which are made of inexpensive plastic and most often look quite stupid. Here, by contrast, aluminum, glass, textiles - a natural continuation of the overall style of the company.

        This is a huge set of brand new packaging technologies that immediately seem familiar. From the digital crown Digital Crown that was used in Apple Watch and AirPods Max to the orange elements with an explicit reference to the company’s Ultra smartwatch range. The designers are clearly 100%.</p>

    <span>Usability</span>
    <p>Apple Vision Pro thought through to the smallest details, so that the device could be used comfortably and at least all day long. To do this, he has a well-designed design, and the most pleasant tactile materials that fit tightly to the face regardless of his features.

      Equally important are the performance of the device, as well as the quality and smoothness of the picture. They are at such a high level that they do not lead to unpleasant sensations for the vestibular apparatus than previously sinned virtual reality headsets of different levels.</p>

  <h2>Comparative images with other Apple products</h2>
  <p>The Apple design has always been minimalist and simple. The company strives to create products that are exclusively functional and easy to use. Redundant details are eliminated and focus on key elements. The principle of "less is more" reflects Apple’s ideology, where every detail matters and nothing is redundant.
